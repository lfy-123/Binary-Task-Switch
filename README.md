# Abstract
As an effective approach to equip models with multi-task capabilities without additional training, model merging has garnered significant attention. However, existing merging methods face challenges of redundant parameter conflicts and the excessive storage burden of fine-tuned parameters. In this work, through controlled experiments, we reveal that for fine-tuned task vectors, only those parameters with magnitudes above a certain threshold contribute positively to the task, exhibiting a pulse-like characteristic. We then attempt leveraging this pulse-like characteristic to binarize the task vectors and reduce storage overhead. Further controlled experiments show that the binarized task vectors incur almost no decrease in fine-tuning and merging performance, and even exhibit stronger performance improvements as the proportion of redundant parameters increases. Based on these insights, we propose Task Switch (T-Switch), which decomposes task vectors into three components: 1) an activation switch instantiated by a binarized mask vector, 2) a polarity switch instantiated by a binarized sign vector, and 3) a scaling knob instantiated by a scalar coefficient. By storing task vectors in a binarized form, T-Switch alleviates parameter conflicts while ensuring efficient task parameter storage. Furthermore, to enable automated switch combination in T-Switch, we further introduce Auto-Switch, which enables training-free switch combination via retrieval from a small query set. Experiments indicate that our methods achieve significant performance improvements over existing baselines, requiring only 1-3$\%$ of the storage space of full-precision parameters.

**Figure2**: Overview of our method: T-Switch and Auto-Switch. The left side illustrates the construction process of the task switch, where noise parameters in the task vectors are discarded, and the remaining parameters are binarized to form the task switch. The upper right corner shows the inference process of our T-Switch using the task switch. The lower right corner demonstrates how our Auto-Switch automatically selects the task switch based on data features.
